Bias towards minimal code with no defensive programming (even if it fails fast). Rely and leverage strict assumptions / invariants that are reasonable to expect from the codebase.
Bias towards smaller code changes, even if it results in uglier UI.
Explicitly consider all pareto-optimal solutions, then explicitly argue why certain trade-offs OUTWEIGH one another.
